The `floods` dataset provides high-quality flood extent labels across different periods derived from satellite observations. Detecting water presence during flood events aids flood risk management, emergency response, and long-term planning for flood-prone areas. Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat sensors are supported.
