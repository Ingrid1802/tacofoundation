With methane leak human-interpretation labeling, it can assist in training machine learning models to detect methane emissions automatically, crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and assessing climate impact mitigation efforts. Sentinel-2, Landsat, PRISMA, and EnMAP sensors are supported.";
